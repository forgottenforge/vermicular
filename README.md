# VERMICULAR: A Hardware-Optimized Quantum Search Algorithm

_Achieving 93% Success Rate on Superconducting Quantum Computers_

---

## Abstract

**VERMICULAR** is a hardware-optimized variant of Grover's quantum search algorithm that tackles a common challenge in quantum computing: the performance gap between simulation and real hardware. Standard implementations often achieve 15-25% success rates on current QPUs, which can limit practical applications.
Through strategic placement of dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences and circuit optimization, VERMICULAR demonstrates improved success rates: 93% on IQM Garnet and 98% on Rigetti Ankaa-3. This improvement may help enable:

- More reliable quantum operations: Better consistency across different hardware platforms
- Efficient resource usage: Improved success rates can reduce the number of required runs
- Complex quantum workflows: Multi-stage operations show enhanced stability
- Practical algorithm deployment: Performance suitable for real-world testing

The approach adds modest overhead (20 gates for 2-qubit search) while providing noise resilience on NISQ devices. The results suggest that algorithm-level optimizations can complement hardware improvements in making quantum computing more practical.
Complete implementation details and experimental data are provided to support reproducibility and further development of the approach.

## Introduction

Grover‚Äôs algorithm provides quadratic speedup for unstructured search, but its usefulness on today‚Äôs quantum hardware is severely limited by noise and decoherence. Standard implementations often achieve <20% success rates in practice.

**VERMICULAR** (VERsatile Modified Iterative Circuit Using Linearly-Arranged Redundancy) is a hardware-optimized version that achieves:
- **93%** success on IQM Garnet (20 qubits)
- **98%** on Rigetti Ankaa-3 (84 qubits)
- **100%** on simulators

The key innovation: _strategic placement of dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences_ that protect quantum information during execution without disrupting logic.

## Background

### Grover‚Äôs Algorithm

- **Initialization**: Prepare uniform superposition  
  $\ket{s} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{x=0}^{N-1}\ket{x}$
- **Grover Iteration** (repeat $\approx \frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}$ times):
    - Oracle $O_f$: Flips phase of marked states
    - Diffusion $D$: Inversion about average
- **Measurement**: Yields marked item with high probability

### Hardware Challenges

- **Gate errors:** ~0.1‚Äì1% per 2-qubit gate
- **Decoherence:** $T_1$, $T_2$ ~ 10‚Äì100 Œºs
- **Crosstalk, calibration drift:** All degrade performance rapidly for circuits with depth >10‚Äì20.

## The VERMICULAR Algorithm

### Core Innovation: Strategic DD Placement

VERMICULAR enhances Grover‚Äôs algorithm with DD sequences:

```
1. Initialize qubits in |0>
2. Hadamard gates to create superposition
3. Apply DD sequence   // Pre-oracle
4. Apply Oracle O_f
5. Apply Diffusion D
6. Apply DD sequence   // Post-diffusion
7. Measure qubits
```

**DD sequences** use paired X gates that cancel systematic errors while preserving the quantum state:
- $DD = X_i X_i = I$

This simple identity has a profound effect on real hardware by refocusing coherent errors.

### Circuit Example (2 Qubits, 14 Gates)

```
q0: H ‚Äî X ‚Äî X ‚Äî‚Ä¢‚Äî H ‚Äî X ‚Äî‚Ä¢‚Äî X ‚Äî H ‚Äî X ‚Äî X
q1: H ‚Äî X ‚Äî X ‚ÄîZ‚Äî H ‚Äî X ‚ÄîZ‚Äî X ‚Äî H ‚Äî X ‚Äî X
```
The XX pairs implement dynamical decoupling.

        self.n_qubits = 2
        self.dd_positions = ['pre_oracle', 'post_diffusion']

    def create_circuit(self) -> Circuit:

    counts[value] = counts.get(value, 0) + 1
success_rate = counts.get(3, 0) / 1000  # Should be ~0.93

## Multi-Stage Search Performance (db_vs.py)
We evaluated VERMICULAR's performance for sequential quantum searches using Rigetti Ankaa-3 hardware. The test involved finding three 2-bit targets in sequence, simulating realistic multi-stage database search scenarios.

**Key Findings:**
- Stage 1: Both algorithms performed similarly (~93% success rate)
- Stage 2: VERMICULAR maintained 84.5% vs. standard Grover's 21.0% (4√ó improvement)
- Stage 3: VERMICULAR achieved 88.5% vs. standard Grover's 28.5% (3.1√ó improvement)

**Overall System Performance:**
- Standard Grover: 5.6% total success rate (all three stages)
- VERMICULAR: 69.2% total success rate
- Net improvement: 12.4√ó reliability

**Performance Degradation Pattern:**
Standard Grover shows significant performance degradation in later stages, likely due to accumulated noise and increased circuit depth. VERMICULAR maintains consistent 84-92% success rates across all stages.

## Technical Analysis

**Noise Resilience**
- Coherent errors: Reduced through XX sequence timing
- Slow drift: Hardware recalibration during DD delays
- Crosstalk: Minimized impact through strategic gate placement

**Why VERMICULAR Works**
- Timing optimization: DD sequences provide calibrated delays
- Error refocusing: Strategic placement at vulnerable circuit points
- Minimal overhead: Only 4 additional gates for substantial improvement

**Limitations**
- Currently optimized for 2-qubit systems
- DD effectiveness depends on hardware characteristics
- Requires gate times much shorter than $T_2$ (satisfied by current hardware)
- Performance benefits most pronounced for deep circuits (>20 gates)

---

### Future Work

- Extension to larger qubit systems
- Adaptive DD placement
- Integration with error mitigation
- Application to further algorithms

## Conclusion

VERMICULAR demonstrates that practical quantum search is achievable on current NISQ devices through careful circuit optimization. With 93-98% success rates on real hardware and 12√ó improvement for multi-stage operations, it bridges the gap between theoretical quantum advantage and practical implementation.

## How we forge
ForgottenForge develops metrics to characterize quantum algorithms. Imagine you want to measure the "health" of a quantum algorithm - not just whether it works, but how robust it is under different conditions.

Quantum-Ritus

2. identification ‚Üí ‚ÄúTemporal decoherence dominates‚Äù
3. targeted solution ‚Üí ‚ÄúDD at positions X,Y‚Äù
4. validation ‚Üí "93% constant performance"

**What makes it special:**
- **Predictive power:** Long-term behaviour can be predicted from just a few measurement points
- **Hardware agnostic:** The patterns are universal, but the parameters are hardware-specific
- **Optimization guide:** Shows exactly where and how to optimize
